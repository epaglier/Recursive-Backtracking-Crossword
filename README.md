This is a recursive algorithm that I made my senior year of highschool.

To run, execute Crossword.java
("java Crossword" in command line)

Try editing Crossword.txt to make new maps. 'X' stands for a blocked space, '.' stands for an open space.

Some crosswords are unsolvable by this AI, and it can take a few hours to complete on especially hard ones.

Let me know of any changes you would like to see! And as always...
Enjoy!
